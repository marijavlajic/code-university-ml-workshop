    "#### Overfitting and Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a common problem that happens when building models. It's called _overfitting_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a model is to learn generalizations from a training set of data and use these generalizations to predict future unknown examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our generalizations are only as good as the diversity of our training set/previous examples. Overfitting happens when you learn too much from a specific set of examples, in a way that makes them worse generalizations for unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can easily happen if we always use the same training and test sets. We can get really good at learning exactly the right coefficients and parameters for our models, so that we always do well on our test set. Then when we get unseen data in the future, we perform terribly, because the data are not similar to the test set we worked with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where cross validation can come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "With cross validation, we use the same data, but work with several train/test splits of that data. We average the accuracy across all runs with these different train/test splits and use that as the accuracy of our model. By using different splits, we get a more diverse set of test sets and it is more likely that our learned model can handle more diverse examples in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation allows us to make more use of the data we have, and create better generalizing models, without having to collect significantly more data (though of course, the more examples you have, the better!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `cross_val_score` to compute the cross-validation accuracy score of model. The `cv` parameter determines cross-validation splitting strategy. For an integer (N), it splits the data into N training and test sets and determines the accuracy score for each of them. N can be as large as the number of your samples; when N is equal to the number of samples we call that _leave one out_. In each step of leave one out cross validation we only have 1 data point in our test set, and all but one data points in the training set."
